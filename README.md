# TrestleLabs - Scanner App with Auto-Crop & Firebase Hosting

## Project Overview
This is a React application that allows users to upload images, automatically crop documents using custom image processing, zoom and pan the scanned images, and maintain a gallery of past scans. The app is deployed live using Firebase Hosting.

## Features
- Upload images for scanning
- Automated document auto-cropping for clean scans
- Zoom and pan functionality on scanned documents
- User gallery to view previously scanned images
- Responsive UI design for cross-device compatibility
- Hosted live on Firebase with fast and secure delivery

## Technologies Used
- React.js for frontend interface
- Firebase Hosting for deployment and static asset serving
- JavaScript libraries for image processing (e.g., OpenCV.js or custom code)
- CSS for styling and responsive layouts

## Installation & Setup

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yashashwinia/TrestleLabs.git
cd TrestleLabs

Install dependencies:
npm install

Build the React app for production:
npm run build

Deploy to Firebase Hosting (make sure you have Firebase CLI installed and configured):
firebase deploy --only hosting
## Running Locally
For development, run:npm start

This will start the app locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

## Live Demo

The app is deployed and accessible here:

## Future Improvements

- Enhance auto-cropping accuracy with machine learning models  
- Add user authentication for personalized galleries and saving scans  
- Implement backend storage and synchronization for images  
- Introduce additional image editing and annotation features  
- Optimize app performance and loading time
